                        <p>Hi there! My name is Polina, I am an information technology student at RMIT University.
                            I moved to Australia from Russia 3 years ago. I’m an overseas qualified lawyer and I work as a paralegal in a law firm in Sydney. 
                            I enjoy hiking, rock climbing and art. Fun fact about me: I had a giant pet snail. Not a fun fact is that such snails are illegal in Australia, 
                            so it could not move here with me. 
                         </p>

                        <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="sectionContent">
                        <p>My interest in IT started about 3 years ago. When I moved to Australia, I was not sure what I wanted to do in life. 
                            I would need to study again to become a lawyer here and I am not very passionate about the legal profession, so I was researching other options. 
                            I was also thinking that it is important to have transferable skills I can use anywhere in the world in case I move again! 
                            Shortly after I joined codecademy.com and I tried a few different courses there. 
                        </p>
                        <p> I liked studying myself, but I realised I lacked self-discipline. I needed something more serious, and I also wanted to study at university. 
                            My husband’s cousin who graduated from RMIT recommended me this degree. It was also important for me to study online as I work full time. 
                            The fact that there were no requirements to enrol was very handy, as I did not go to high school in Australia.  
                        </p>
                        <p> During my studies, I expect to gain a deep understanding of IT trends and conceptions, learn to code well and figure out the area I would like to specialise in. 
                            I am currently interested in front end/UX design as I have tried studying this a bit. I am sure there is more to that, and I am eager to explore other areas!

                        <h3>Description</h3>
                        <p>My ideal job is a front end engineer role within a cross-functional team. 
                            This role involves collaborating with team members to create responsive applications and design accessibility solutions. 
                            Front end role is particularly appealing to me because engineers are able to transform an idea into a useful product. 
                            Front end developer makes a functional website or application that is easy and pleasant to use which contributes to business success. 
                            I chose this job advertisement because of the social impact the company is creating as they are helping the vulnerable members of the community <cite>(Seek.com.au, 2022)</cite>. 
                        </p>

                        <h3>Skills I have</h3>
                        <p>I have strong communicating skills as my previous work experience exposed me to a variety of people, from refugees to CEOs. 
                            I have a can-do attitude and I find a solution in any situation.  
                            I also have experience in managing a team and extensive experience of being a part of a large team where collaboration is essential. 
                            As for the technical skills, I am currently studying HTML, CSS, GitHub, Python and UX design basics. 
                        </p>

                        <h3>Skills I Need</h3>

                        <p>According to the test results, I am a Turbulent Logician (INTP-T) and analyst. 
                            This type represents a socially selective, rational person who is driven by self-improvement. 
                            Logicians tend to get tired out by extensive socializing, they prefer exchanging ideas instead. 
                            They are strong at analysing information and coming up with creating ideas, they often create innovations. 
                            Logicians are driven by curiosity and often get absorbed with a new interest or area of research. On the other hand, 
                            people of this type are often dissatisfied with the current state of things which lead to another weakness: perfectionism.
                            Logicians are resourceful and focused workers <cite>(16personalities.com, 2022)</cite>.</p>

                            Reflectors prefer observing the environment and they tend to be cautious. 
                            They tend to collect and analyse information to come to their conclusions, which they may take considerable time and effort to develop. 
                            The recommended study methods for reflectors are paired discussions, demonstrations and feedback from others (Medical University of Vienna, n.d.). <cite>(Medical University of Vienna, n.d.)</cite>.

                        <p>Psychometrics Project test revealed that I am very introverted but very friendly and optimistic.

                        <br> <br>
                            I scored low on emotional stability, but at the same time I am a highly organised, diligent individual with vivid imagination <cite>(Openpsychometrics.org, 2019)</cite>.  
                        </p>

                        <p> I am a bit sceptical of these tests as they are quite vague and can suit a variety of completely different people. 
                            I believe it is hard to assess a personality through a short website test. In general, the results of all 3 tests were similar, so I think they are relatively accurate. 
                            I can definitely use the results to reflect on my behaviour or use it to adjust my studying techniques. It is also useful to understand how I possibly interact with people. 
                        </p>
                        <p> I agree with the first personality test that my type of personality does not like small talk and chitchat, but generally communicating with other people is inspirational and nourishing to me. 
                            I am agreeable and even though I am deeply introverted, it is not a problem for me to communicate with people easily. 
                        </p>
                        <p> When forming a team, I would not fit into a group with aggressive and disorganised members. 
                            I’m a helpful collaborator and would enjoy working with a team of mind like people. 
                            I agree with the test results that one of my weaknesses can be perfectionism and it might make me work on certain things longer.

                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p> Modern technologies give us a great opportunity to access information and experience different cultures. 
                            My project idea will combine these features together in a fun way. 
                            I suggest creating a smartphone application that would be contributing to gaining cultural experience as well as entertainment. 
                            The app will ask the user to choose a year (or maybe a decade or a century if we go further) and a country, and it will return a popular music album, a book and a movie from those times.
                        </p>

                    <article>
                        <h2>Motivation</h2>
                        <p>Recently, streaming services like Netflix and Spotify became increasingly popular thanks to sophisticated search engines. 
                            These algorithms play a significant role in providing good user experience. 
                            Statistic shows that Netflix Recommendation Engine is so accurate that 80% of Netflix viewer activity is driven by personalised recommendation <cite>(Meltzer, R., n.d.)</cite>. 
                            But what do we do when we want to explore fun things that are not based on our previous preferences? 
                            This application would be a helpful tool in exploring new cultures, history, new genres and artwork. 
                        </p>

                    <article>
                        <h2>Description</h2>
                        <p>The idea of this application is simple: the user will provide 2 inputs (a year and a country) and the app will return 3 outputs: 
                            a musical album, a movie and a book released in a chosen country and year. Once our parameters are chosen, 
                            the app will provide a brief description of the items. For example, short information about the musical artist, movie and a book plot. 
                            The application will show the images as well (album cover, movie poster and a book cover). An important thing would be linking these items to the servers where the users can access them. 
                            For example, it can be linked to Spotify, Netflix or YouTube movies and Booktopia respectively. 
                            Visually it will look like a clickable map of the world with the years list on the side. 
                            The app will have an interactivity element: users will be able to contribute and provide suggested artwork. 
                            In order to do that, the app will include a registration form and a section with the information they need to provide so a new item can be added to the database.

                        <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
                        <p>The proposed application will combine front-end and back-end technologies. 
                            The back-end side will consist of a database with countries, years, movies, music albums and books. 
                            By providing 2 inputs the user will be able to retrieve the information from the database. 
                            As we want the application to provide multiple outputs, for each input we need to store multiple options, which makes the database even bigger. 
                            In order to store all the data we can use PostgreSQL. Cloudinary can be used to store images and list of our content. 
                            The front-end side of the app can be built on React and the back end can be built on Node <cite>(Barger R., 2021)</cite>.</p>

                            As this is a potential team project, good communication and soft skills are needed. 
                            The hard skills will include advanced programming using React, Node and JavaScript.
                            It is also important to understand how all these parts will be connected and how the database will be organised. 
                            For the UX part of the project, such tools as Figma or Adobe XD will be used. 
                            I believe it will be feasible to find the skills and create the simplest version of this app within a short timeframe.

                        <h2>Outcome</h2>
                        <p>As I stated in my introduction, I adore art and design. 
                           I believe this project will help me to develop my skills both in front-end and back-end and give me a full understanding how to make a useful smartphone application. 
                           Once the project is completed, we will have a great entertaining and at the same time educational tool.
